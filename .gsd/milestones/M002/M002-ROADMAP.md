# M002: Reliability + Hosted Launch

**Vision:** Fix the current reliability gaps in Transcript Library, restore trust in analysis and source sync behavior, and launch the app privately on Proxmox behind Cloudflare-managed friend access with unattended daily automation in place.

## Success Criteria

- Approved friends can reach the hosted app privately at the target domain without app-managed passwords.
- New transcript content from the upstream transcript repo appears in the library automatically without manual catalog repair.
- A hosted user can trigger analysis on demand and receive a completed result with durable runtime artifacts.
- Existing broken runtime/artifact states are surfaced clearly and can be repaired by rerun rather than remaining opaque failures.
- Daily unattended automation refreshes source data and reduces visible runtime drift in normal use.
- Deploys to the hosted environment are repeatable, rollback-friendly, and preserve persistent runtime data outside the release tree.

## Key Risks / Unknowns

- Analysis generation is currently failing with exit code 1, and the root cause may sit in provider auth, command invocation, prompt/output shape, or hosted environment assumptions.
- Historical checked-in artifacts already show runtime mismatch states, which means the runtime contract may not yet be robust enough for unattended repair automation.
- The source repo refresh path is not trustworthy right now, so deployment alone would just host stale or drifting data.
- Cloudflare-managed friend access and hosted analysis runtime both need real-world proof; repo docs alone are not enough.

## Proof Strategy

- Exit-code-1 analysis failures → retire in S01 by proving at least one currently failing video can complete a full on-demand analysis run with explainable evidence for failures that remain.
- Runtime/artifact drift on older videos → retire in S02 by proving broken historical examples become rerunnable and their failure state is operator-readable.
- Source sync uncertainty → retire in S03 by proving a real upstream change reaches the app automatically through the intended refresh path.
- Hosted launch uncertainty → retire in S07 by proving private access, hosted browse, hosted analysis, and unattended automation all work together in the real deployed topology.

## Verification Classes

- Contract verification: targeted Vitest coverage, artifact file checks, route responses, runtime record inspection, and script-level verification
- Integration verification: real interaction with the transcript source repo, hosted runtime layout, Cloudflare gate, and analysis provider CLI
- Operational verification: deploy/restart behavior, scheduled sync/repair automation, persistent storage behavior, and rollback-friendly release layout
- UAT / human verification: confirm approved-friend access flow and hosted experience feel right after deployment

## Milestone Definition of Done

This milestone is complete only when all are true:

- all slices deliver their promised user-visible or runtime-visible outcomes
- analysis, sync, automation, access, and deployment behaviors are actually wired together in the hosted topology
- the real hosted entrypoint exists and is exercised by a friend-style access flow
- success criteria are re-checked against live behavior rather than inferred from documentation alone
- the final integrated acceptance scenarios pass in the deployed environment

## Requirement Coverage

- Covers: R001, R002, R003, R004, R005, R006, R007, R008, R009, R010, R011
- Partially covers: R012 (only by avoiding architecture dead ends while launching the current single-playlist system)
- Leaves for later: R013, R014, R015, R201, R202, R203
- Orphan risks: none

## Slices

- [x] **S01: Runtime Failure Triage and Analysis Recovery** `risk:high` `depends:[]`

  > After this: at least one currently failing video can complete an end-to-end analysis run again, and remaining failure modes produce concrete operator evidence instead of opaque exit-code-1 behavior.

- [x] **S02: Historical Artifact Repair and Drift Recovery** `risk:high` `depends:[S01]`

  > After this: known broken historical videos surface clear rerun-ready state, and repair paths can bring representative drifted artifacts back into a clean runtime state.

- [x] **S03: Source Repo Sync Contract and Auto-Refresh** `risk:high` `depends:[S01]`

  > After this: a real upstream transcript update flows into the app automatically, with the cross-repo refresh contract documented and enforced clearly enough for unattended use.

- [ ] **S04: Daily Operational Sweep and Repair Automation** `risk:medium` `depends:[S02,S03]`

  > After this: an unattended daily job can refresh source data, detect/repair runtime drift, and leave evidence of what it fixed or could not fix.

- [ ] **S05: Hosted Auth and Access Shape** `risk:medium` `depends:[S03]`

  > After this: the intended private-friend access flow is operationally defined around Cloudflare-managed access, with approved users reaching the app without app-password scope.

- [ ] **S06: Proxmox Runtime and Release Pipeline** `risk:high` `depends:[S03,S05]`

  > After this: the app runs on the target Proxmox layout with persistent storage, supervised process management, and unattended deploy/restart mechanics that preserve rollback paths.

- [ ] **S07: End-to-End Hosted Launch Proof** `risk:high` `depends:[S04,S06]`
  > After this: the real hosted system proves private access, fresh synced content, on-demand analysis, and unattended automation working together for the launch experience.

## Boundary Map

### S01 → S02

Produces:

- a verified root-cause map for current analysis failures, including the concrete failing surfaces and their evidence paths
- corrected analysis runtime behavior for the representative exit-code-1 case(s)
- stable expectations for when a run is considered failed, rerunnable, or successfully completed

Consumes:

- nothing (first slice)

### S01 → S03

Produces:

- a trustworthy analysis/runtime baseline that downstream sync work can use when new content is discovered
- any runtime-side fixes required so sync-added videos do not inherit the same broken analysis path

Consumes:

- nothing (first slice)

### S02 → S04

Produces:

- repairable mismatch categories and the operator-safe repair/rerun rules for each one
- representative repaired artifact states that define what the daily sweep is allowed to fix automatically

- a repeatable sync/update mechanism that can be invoked by unattended automation
- observable evidence for what changed during a refresh cycle

### S06 → S07
