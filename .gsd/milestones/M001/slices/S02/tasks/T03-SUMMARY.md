# T03: 02-sqlite-catalog 03

**# Phase 2 Plan 3: SQLite Catalog Cutover Hardening Summary**

## What Happened

# Phase 2 Plan 3: SQLite Catalog Cutover Hardening Summary

**Durable catalog parity reporting, version-aware SQLite cache invalidation, and refresh-driven operational workflows for browse-safe cutover**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 9 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-10T03:07:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-10T03:15:57Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 12

## Accomplishments

- Added a durable `last-import-validation.json` report with catalog counts, malformed-row details, parity status, and a shared `catalogVersion` signal.
- Hardened the importer against real transcript-index legacy shapes while preserving last-known-good SQLite cutover behavior.
- Aligned runtime caching, sync automation, nightly analysis, and docs around SQLite as the only browse authority.

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add parity and validation reporting to catalog refresh** - `94f66b9` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Align runtime caching and refresh callers with the new catalog authority** - `ebb251f` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Document the refresh and cutover contract** - `81cd24e` (docs)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/lib/catalog-import.ts` - writes validation reports, catalog versions, and normalizes legacy duplicate catalog row shapes during rebuild.
- `scripts/rebuild-catalog.ts` - emits validation report and catalog version metadata for operators.
- `data/catalog/last-import-validation.json` - records the latest real catalog validation result for runtime and operational visibility.
- `src/lib/catalog.ts` - invalidates the in-process catalog snapshot using refresh metadata instead of only DB mtime.
- `src/app/api/sync-hook/route.ts` - refreshes SQLite before batch analysis walks browse metadata.
- `scripts/nightly-insights.ts` - rebuilds SQLite first and uses the shared catalog transcript-path/runtime authority.
- `src/lib/__tests__/catalog-parity.test.ts` - covers durable validation report success/failure behavior.
- `src/lib/__tests__/catalog-cache.test.ts` - covers cache reuse and invalidation after refresh.
- `README.md` and `docs/architecture/system-overview.md` - document SQLite-only browse reads, rebuild commands, and validation failure handling.

## Decisions Made

- Used `last-import-validation.json` as the durable metadata contract for both operators and runtime cache invalidation so there is one refresh signal, not separate cutover logic.
- Normalized blank single-part chunk metadata and duplicate chunk copies from the live transcript index instead of treating them as fatal refresh failures.
- Kept refresh automation on existing surfaces (`scripts/rebuild-catalog.ts`, `POST /api/sync-hook`, and `scripts/nightly-insights.ts`) rather than introducing a new management UI.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Persisted validation reports even when import normalization fails before SQLite write**

- **Found during:** Task 1 (Add parity and validation reporting to catalog refresh)
- **Issue:** Early input-shape failures could throw before `last-import-validation.json` was written, leaving stale or missing operator state.
- **Fix:** Moved validation-context setup ahead of record normalization and wrote failure reports for pre-write import errors.
- **Files modified:** `src/lib/catalog-import.ts`, `src/lib/__tests__/catalog-import-validation.test.ts`, `src/lib/__tests__/catalog-parity.test.ts`
- **Verification:** `npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/catalog-parity.test.ts src/lib/__tests__/catalog-import-validation.test.ts`
- **Committed in:** `94f66b9` (part of task commit)

**2. [Rule 1 - Bug] Normalized legacy single-part and duplicate-copy rows from the real transcript index**

- **Found during:** Task 1 (Add parity and validation reporting to catalog refresh)
- **Issue:** The live `videos.csv` included blank chunk metadata for single-part videos and duplicate chunk sets for alternate slug copies, which caused validation to reject otherwise usable catalog data.
- **Fix:** Canonicalized blank single-part rows to chunk `1`, collapsed duplicate single-part listings to one transcript part, and ignored later duplicate chunk copies while still enforcing declared part-count parity.
- **Files modified:** `src/lib/catalog-import.ts`, `src/lib/__tests__/catalog-sqlite-import.test.ts`, `data/catalog/last-import-validation.json`
- **Verification:** `node scripts/rebuild-catalog.ts --check` and `npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/catalog-sqlite-import.test.ts`
- **Committed in:** `94f66b9` (part of task commit)

---

**Total deviations:** 2 auto-fixed (1 blocking, 1 bug)
**Impact on plan:** Both fixes were necessary to make the refresh contract work against the real transcript index without weakening last-known-good protection. No scope creep.

## Issues Encountered

- The live transcript index contained legacy duplicate-row shapes that were not covered by earlier fixture tests, so the importer had to become more tolerant while keeping parity enforcement strict.
- The `node` TypeScript loader still emits a `MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON` warning for script execution, but it does not block rebuild/check behavior and stayed out of this plan’s scope.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- SQLite browse cutover is now guarded by durable validation reports, explicit refresh automation, and version-aware cache invalidation.
- Phase 3 can build durable runtime orchestration on top of one browse authority instead of reasoning about CSV fallback or stale catalog state.

## Self-Check

PASSED

- Found `.planning/phases/02-sqlite-catalog/02-03-SUMMARY.md`
- Found commits `94f66b9`, `ebb251f`, and `81cd24e`
